Q1. What is your understanding of Blockchain ?

Ans: A blockchain is a digital record of transactions.
       The name comes from its structure, in which individual records, called blocks, are linked together in single list, called a chain. 
       Each transaction added to a blockchain is validated by multiple computers on the Internet.

Q2. What is the core problem blockchain trying to solve ?

Ans: The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited.
        Blockchain Addresses the Problem of Data Security and Trust by Making the Ledger Public.
        Hardware and software errors are not the only data security issue.
        The blockchain has to also protect itself from willful fraud and theft.

Q3. What is the few features which blockchain will give you ?
       
Ans: We have a public distributed ledger, which works using a hashing encryption.
        Every block has a hash value, which is the digital signature of the block.
        All the transactions are approved and verified on the Blockchain network using a proof-of-work consensus algorithm.

Q4. What all things does a block contain ?

Ans:  ~ Block number   ~ Transaction records   ~ Previous Block Key   ~Mining key

Q5. How is the verifiability of blockchain has been attained ?

Ans:  Validated transactions are stored into a block and are sealt with a lock (hash).
         This block becomes part of the blockchain when other computers in the network validate if the lock on the block is correct.
         Now the transaction is part of the blockchain and can not be altered in any way
